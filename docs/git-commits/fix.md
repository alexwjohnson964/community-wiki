# Fix

The `fix` tag categorizes a change as one that fixes a known issue with the code base and is one of the tags that will be used regularly during all stages of development.

Some examples of changes that would count as fixes are as follows:

- Fixing an issue with how data is stored in the database
- Fixing a UI bug that user's have mentioned
- Fixing an issue with how an AI system takes in data

Basically any changes that address known issues or any problems that the code is suffering from.

Examples:

- `fix(login-page): properly check that email is valid`
- `fix(user-controller): handle null pointer exceptions`
