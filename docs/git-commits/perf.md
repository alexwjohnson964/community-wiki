# Perf

The `perf` tag categorizes a change as one that aims to improve the performance of some aspect of the code/project and is one of the tags that will be used most after the initial development phase of the code base.

Some examples of changes that would count as performance improvements are as follows:

- Reworking algorithms
- Optimizing data structure
- Scalability solutions from direct code changes

Basically if anything would improve the overall performance of the code in its functions then it would be given the `perf` tag.

Examples:

- `perf(user-controller): use user id with index for fetching from database`
- `perf: use heap for managing weighted tasks over list`
