# CI

The `ci` tag categorizes a change as on that alters the CI/CD pipeline of the project.

Some examples of changes that would count as a CI/CD change are as follows:

- Changing automated testing methods
- Changing automated deployment of code

Basically if anything changes the way that the CI/CD pipeline of the code base works then it should be given the `ci` tag.

Examples:

- `ci(github-actions): added testing on push`
- `ci: added automated deployment to VM`
