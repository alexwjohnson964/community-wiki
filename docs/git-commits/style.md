# Style

The `style` tag categorizes a change as one that alters the styling of the code or any of its associated linters/formatters.

Some examples of changes that would count as style related changes are as follows:

- Adding/Changing linter settings
- Running IDE formatter on code

Basically if anything changes the way that the code is formatted or how automated style handles are configured then it should be given the `style` tag.

Examples:

- `style(user-controller): ran updated formatter on controller`
- `style: changed indenting in linter from 1 to 2`
