# Feat

The `feat` tag categorizes a change as one that brings in a new feature to the code/project and is one of the tags that will be used the most during initial development of a code base.

Some examples of changes that would count as features are as follows:

- New routes in an API
- New components of a frontent application
- New entities in a game engine

Basically if anything is added that wasn't there before and adds a new functionality that can be used by either other developers or users then it should be given the `feat` tag.

Examples:

- `feat(user-controller): created signup route`
- `feat: implemented slideshow component`
- `feat: created NPC entitiy framework`
