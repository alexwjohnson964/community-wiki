# Docs

The `docs` tag categorizes a change as one that makes changes to the documentation of the code either in the form of comments or related documentation files like the README.

Some examples of changes that would count as documentation are as follows:

- Changes that only alter comments in the code
- Changes that only alter related documentation of the code base

Basically if anything is changed regarding documentation of the code/project then it should be given the `docs` tag.

Examples:

- `docs(user-controller): added helper method comments`
- `docs: updated README with updated contact information`
