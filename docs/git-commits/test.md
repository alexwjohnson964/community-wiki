# Test

The `test` tag categorizes a change as one that adds or alters any tests that are made for the code base.

Some examples of changes that would count as tests are as follows:

- Adding a new test
- Modifying an exising test

Basically if anything is changed that is related to the testing of the code base then it should be given the `test` tag.

Examples:

- `test(user-controller): add tests for signup route`
- `test: use testcontainers for all tests`
