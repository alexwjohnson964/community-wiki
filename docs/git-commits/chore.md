# Chore

The `chore` tag categorizes a change as one that handles miscellaneous management of the code base.

Some examples of changes that would count as chores are as follows:

- Changing the version number for the project
- Changes to the Git settings of the project
- Changes to dependencies of the project

Basically if anything is changed that does not neatly fit into any other tag then it should be given the `chore` tag.

Examples:

- `chore(dependencies): updated dependencies to newest version`
- `chore: added _dev to gitignore`
